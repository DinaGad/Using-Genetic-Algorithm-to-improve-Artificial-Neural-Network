# Using-Genetic-Algorithm-to-improve-Artificial-Neural-Network
Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Netowrk

Matlab version: R2014a or above

Two toolboxes are needed: Neural Network Toolbox and Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox
Neural Network Toolbox has been available in latest Matlab version
Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox can be accessed by: https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/kay/, Software: GAOT.

How to run this software:
1. Download Genetic Algorithm Optimization Toolbox (named gaot) from above website
2. Keep the GABPNET.m, gadecod.m, gabpEval.m and gaot in the same file holder
3. Run the GABPNET.m file

Notice:
1. The input data in the code ('p', 't') can also be loaed by .txt or .mat file if the size of input is larger.
